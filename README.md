Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about passengers, including features like age, sex, ticket class, and more.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and can be downloaded from the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition page.

The dataset consists of two files:

train.csv: The training dataset containing the features and the target variable (Survived).
test.csv: The test dataset used to evaluate the model's performance.
Features
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
Target Variable
Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (Whether the passenger survived or not).
